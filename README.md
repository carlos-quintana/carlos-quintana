## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my page!
I'm Carlos, graduate Software Developer, **currently available for work**.


> 💼 [See my web portfolio](https://carlos-quintana.github.io/)


I'm passionate about building beautiful web applications, and I'm expanding my skillset for a broader Fullstack range.


💻 Some of the technologies I'm working with are:
- **HTML 5**, **CSS 3** and **SASS**.
- **JavaScript** and **TypeScript**.
- **API REST** and **Fetch API**.
- Relational databases and **SQL** with MariaDB (MySQL) and PostgreSQL.
- Non Relational databases with **MongoDB**.

📝 I also have experience working with **Java**, **Python** and **PHP**.

👓 I love to learn new technologies, and I'm currently learning **React JS** to build component based applications, and also **JEST** to write tests in JavaScript.
